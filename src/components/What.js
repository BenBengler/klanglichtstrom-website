      <p>
        “Klang-/Licht STROM” is a collaborative performance project of Ben
        Bengler (music, live electronics) and Thomas Geissl (light,
        programming). It’s driven by our shared vision for creating performances
        where the audience is in the centre of things, with sound and light
        unfolding around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Largely free from strictly timed sequencing, I create and evolve the
        music via real-time audio manipulation and layered sound processing
        techniques. The sound is analysed in real-time and Geissl uses the
        derived data as a raw material, augmenting and manipulating it with a
        custom software tool to creatively drive the the spatial light setup.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way, we try to conjure up an interconnected and fluid
        choreography of sound and light unfolding around the audience.
